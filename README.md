Title: Top Selling Motorcycle in the Philippines


About: The pandas profiling I did was about motorcycle data analysis which contained reviews on the different model of motorcycles, which of the brands were better sold, and which motorcycle is the saftest and reliable for Filipino users and also the date of release of motorcycles. After I made that data, I made a graph for me to see which brand of motorcycle is much better and reliable for many Filipinos motorcycle enthusiast. Pandas profiling is good to use because the output of the generated code comes out immediately.


Conclusions: Pandas-Profiling is an open-source tool written in python that has the ability to generate interactive HTML reports which detail the types of data within the dataset; Provides descriptive statistics including data, standard deviation and skewness. Creates histograms and returns any potential correlations. The overview also provides the number of missing cells or duplicate rows and a percentage of total records that were impacted. The missing cells and duplicate row statistics are quite important as a data quality issues or issues with the code used to extract the data. The overview section also includes data around the size of the dataset in memory, the average record size in memory and any data types that are recognized. This section will display a tab with the number of variable, the DataFrame length, missing values, duplicate data and a list containing the variables data types.
